      "This class represents a signer that is responsible for signing artifacts. It takes an `identity_token`, `signing_ctx`, and an optional `cache` parameter. The `identity_token` is used to verify the identity of the signer, the `signing_ctx` provides the necessary context and dependencies for signing, and the `cache` parameter determines whether to cache the private key and signing certificate.\n",

      "- `__init__(identity_token: IdentityToken, signing_ctx: SigningContext, cache: bool = True)`: Initializes the Signer instance with the provided `identity_token`, `signing_ctx`, and `cache` parameters. If `cache` is `True`, it generates an ephemeral private key and requests an ephemeral certificate.\n",
      "- `_private_key() -> ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey`: Returns the private key. If it is not already cached, it generates a new ephemeral private key.\n",
      "- `_signing_cert(private_key: ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey) -> FulcioCertificateSigningResponse`: Retrieves the signing certificate. If a cached signing certificate exists, it verifies if it has expired and returns it. Otherwise, it retrieves a signed certificate by building an X.509 Certificate Signing Request and sending it to the signing context's `fulcio` endpoint.\n",
      "- `sign(input_: IO[bytes]) -> SigningResult`: Signs the provided input artifact. It verifies the validity period of the identity token, retrieves the signing certificate using the private key, verifies the SCT (Signed Certificate Timestamp), and signs the artifact using the private key.

The exception will be caught and handled by the calling function.\\n\\n```python\\ntry:\\n    # Do something that might raise an exception\\nexcept Exception as e:\\n    # Handle the exception\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nTo use the MyClass class in your code, import it and create a new instance:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom my_module import MyClass\\n\\nmy_object = MyClass('foo', 123)\\n```\\n\\nYou can then call the methods on the object:\\n\\n```python\\nresult = my_object.my_method('bar', 456)\\n```\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nTo test the MyClass class, create a new instance and call the methods:\\n\\n```python\\nimport unittest\\n\\nfrom my_module import MyClass\\n\\nclass TestMyClass(unittest.TestCase):\\n    def test_my_method(self):\\n        my_object = MyClass('foo', 123)\\n        result = my_object.my_method('bar', 456)\\n        self.assertTrue(result)\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    unittest.main()\\n```\\n\\nRun the tests with the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\npython -m unittest\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nIf you would like to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:\\n\\n1.

The exception will be caught and handled by the calling function.\\n\\n```python\\ntry:\\n    # Do something that might raise an exception\\nexcept Exception as e:\\n    # Handle the exception\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nTo use the MyClass class in your code, import it and create a new instance:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom my_module import MyClass\\n\\nmy_object = MyClass('foo', 123)\\n```\\n\\nYou can then call the methods on the object:\\n\\n```python\\nresult = my_object.my_method('bar', 456)\\n```\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nTo test the MyClass class, create a new instance and call the methods:\\n\\n```python\\nimport unittest\\n\\nfrom my_module import MyClass\\n\\nclass TestMyClass(unittest.TestCase):\\n    def test_my_method(self):\\n        my_object = MyClass('foo', 123)\\n        result = my_object.my_method('bar', 456)\\n        self.assertTrue(result)\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    unittest.main()\\n```\\n\\nRun the tests with the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\npython -m unittest\\n```\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nIf you would like to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:\\n\\n1.

It takes an input stream as an argument and returns a SigningResult object.\\n    - verify: This function is used to verify the signature of an artifact using the public key. It takes a SigningResult object as an argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the signature is valid or not.\\n3. Error Handling:\\n    - ExpiredIdentity: This error is raised when the provided identity token is expired.\\n    - ExpiredCertificate: This error is raised when the provided certificate is expired.\\n    - InvalidCertificate: This error is raised when the provided certificate is invalid.\\n    - InvalidSignature: This error is raised when the provided signature is invalid.\\n    - InvalidCertificateChain: This error is raised when the provided certificate chain is invalid.\\n    - InvalidTransparencyLogEntry: This error is raised when the provided transparency log entry is invalid.\\n    - InvalidBundle: This error is raised when the provided bundle is invalid.\\n\\nMake sure to follow this output structure to create API documentation that is clear, concise, accurate, and user-centric.

      "The NetworkError class is a subclass of Error and represents an error that occurs when there is a network issue. It provides specific diagnostics and suggestions for resolving the issue.\n",

      "The Signer class is used for signing artifacts using an elliptic curve private key. It interacts with the FulcioCertificateSigningResponse and SigningContext to generate and retrieve certificates for signing. The signing process involves verifying the identity token, retrieving the certificate, and signing the artifact. The Signer class also provides a method to create a transparency log entry for the signed artifact.\n",

Similarly, the human evaluated scores are in alignment with Langchain scores. However, it is important to note that the human evaluation scores for clarity/completeness are lower compare to the GPT evaluated scores. This indicates that the human scores take into consideration the SMEs perspective when evaluating the generated documentation which GPT does not consider."

    "This is an interesting example since the generated documentation is partially correct. It seems to provide a pretty good description of the API in general, however it fails to capture all the functions/classes provided in the input Python code. Langchain was able to catch this and evaluate the output accordingly by assigning a score of 0 for both correctness and logicalness. It scores 1 for helpfulness as it takes into consideration that the document provides a fairly good overview of the input code provided. The human evaluated scores are compartively similar to Langchain however lower when compared to the GPT evaluated scores."

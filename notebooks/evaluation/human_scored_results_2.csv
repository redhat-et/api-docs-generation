                Another possible reason is that the workflow run has been

                The most common reason for this is incorrect
                configuration of the top-level `permissions` setting of the
                workflow YAML file. It should be configured like so:

                    permissions:
                      id-token: write

                Another possible reason is that the workflow run has been
                triggered by a PR from a forked repository. PRs from forked
                repositories typically cannot be granted write access.

**Class** `IdentityToken`

The `IdentityToken` class represents an identity token obtained from an identity provider. It has the following methods:

- `__init__(raw_token: str) -> None`

    This constructor method initializes an `IdentityToken` object with a raw identity token.

    **Parameters:**
    - `raw_token`: The raw identity token as a string.
    
    **Return Value:** None
    
- `in_validity_period() -> bool`

    This method checks if the identity token is within its validity period.
    
    **Return Value:** A boolean indicating whether the identity token is within its validity period or not.
    
- `identity() -> str`

    This property method returns the identity associated with the identity token.
    
    **Return Value:** The identity as a string.
    
- `issuer() -> str`

    **Return Value:** The issuer as a string.
    
- `expected_certificate_subject() -> str`

    This property method returns the expected subject (issuer) of the certificate bound to the identity token. If the identity token is federated, the federated issuer is returned instead.
    
    **Return Value:** The expected certificate subject as a string.
    
- `__str__() -> str`

    This magic method returns the raw identity token as a string.
    
    **Return Value:** The raw identity token as a string.

**Class** `IssuerError`

The `IssuerError` class is an exception raised when there is an error with the issuer configuration.

---

**Class** `Issuer`

The `Issuer` class represents the identity provider and provides methods to interact with it. It has the following methods:

- `__init__(base_url: str) -> None`

    This constructor method initializes an `Issuer` object with the base URL of the identity provider.
    
    **Parameters:**
    - `base_url`: The base URL of the identity provider.
    
    **Return Value:** None

- `production() -> Issuer`

    This class method returns an `Issuer` object configured for the production environment.
    
    **Return Value:** An `Issuer` object configured for the production environment.

- `staging() -> Issuer`

    This class method returns an `Issuer` object configured for the staging environment.
    
    **Return Value:** An `Issuer` object configured for the staging environment.

- `identity_token(client_id: str = ""sigstore"", client_secret: str = """", force_oob: bool = False) -> IdentityToken`

    This method returns an identity token after performing the authentication flow with the identity provider.
    
    **Parameters:**
    - `client_id`: The client ID to use for authentication. Defaults to ""sigstore"".
    - `client_secret`: The client secret to use for authentication. Defaults to an empty string.
    - `force_oob`: Whether to force the out-of-band authentication flow. Defaults to False.
    
    **Return Value:** An `IdentityToken` object representing the obtained identity token.

Class Documentation:
",verify_models,classes_code,"**Introduction:**

The `VerificationResult` class is a base model that represents the result of a verification process. It contains a boolean attribute `success` indicating whether the verification was successful or not. This class can be used as a base class to define specific success and failure scenarios.

The `VerificationSuccess` class inherits from `VerificationResult` and represents a successful verification. It sets the `success` attribute to `True`.

The `VerificationFailure` class also inherits from `VerificationResult` and represents a failed verification. It sets the `success` attribute to `False` and includes a `reason` attribute to provide additional information about the failure.

The `InvalidMaterials` class extends the `Error` class and represents an issue occurred while parsing the verification materials. It provides a `diagnostics()` method to retrieve specific diagnostic information about the error.

The `RekorEntryMissing` class extends the `Exception` class and represents an error when a specific Rekor entry is missing.

The `InvalidRekorEntry` class extends the `InvalidMaterials` class and represents an error when a Rekor entry is invalid.

**Functions:**

No functions found in the provided code.

**Error Handling:**

The following are the possible error responses and their meanings:

1. `InvalidMaterials` - An issue occurred while parsing the verification materials. The provided verification materials are malformed and may have been modified maliciously. Additional diagnostic information can be obtained using the `diagnostics()` method.

2. `RekorEntryMissing` - Indicates that a specific Rekor entry is missing.

3. `InvalidRekorEntry` - Indicates that a Rekor entry is invalid.",1,1,1,"

Class Documentation:
",sign,classes_code,"**Class Signer**

**Introduction:**
The `Signer` class is responsible for signing data using an identity token and a signing context. It generates an ephemeral private key and requests a signing certificate from a signing context. It uses the private key to sign the data and creates a transparency log entry. 

**Methods:**

1. `__init__(self, identity_token, signing_ctx, cache=True) -> None`

   **Description:** Initializes a Signer instance with an identity token and a signing context. It generates an ephemeral private key and requests a signing certificate if caching is enabled.
   
   **Parameters:**
   - `identity_token` (IdentityToken): The identity token used for signing.
   - `signing_ctx` (SigningContext): The signing context used for requesting a signing certificate.
   - `cache` (bool, optional): Flag indicating whether to cache the private key and signing certificate. Defaults to True.
   
   **Return Value:** None

2. `_private_key(self) -> ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey`

   **Description:** Retrieves the private key. If caching is enabled, it returns the cached private key. Otherwise, it generates a new ephemeral private key.
   
   **Parameters:** None
   
   **Return Value:** ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey: The private key.

3. `_signing_cert(self, private_key) -> FulcioCertificateSigningResponse`
   
   **Description:** Requests a signing certificate using the private key. If a cached signing certificate exists and is not expired, it returns the cached certificate. Otherwise, it retrieves a new signing certificate from the signing context.
   
   **Parameters:**
   - `private_key` (ec.EllipticCurvePrivateKey): The private key used for signing.
   
   **Return Value:** FulcioCertificateSigningResponse: The signing certificate response.

4. `sign(self, input_) -> SigningResult`
   
   **Description:** Signs the input data using the private key. It verifies the validity of the identity token and the signing certificate. Then, it signs the input data, creates a transparency log entry, and returns the signing result.
   
   **Parameters:**
   - `input_` (IO[bytes]): The input data to be signed.
   
   **Return Value:** SigningResult: The signing result.

**Class SigningContext**

**Introduction:**
The `SigningContext` class is responsible for providing a signing context for the `Signer` class. It allows creating a `Signer` instance with specific configurations for the Fulcio and Rekor clients.

**Methods:**

1. `__init__(self, fulcio, rekor)`
   
   **Description:** Initializes a SigningContext instance with Fulcio and Rekor clients.
   
   **Parameters:**
   - `fulcio` (FulcioClient): The Fulcio client.
   - `rekor` (RekorClient): The Rekor client.
   
   **Return Value:** None

2. `production(cls) -> SigningContext`

   **Description:** Creates a production-level SigningContext instance. It creates a FulcioClient and a RekorClient with production settings.
   
   **Parameters:** None
   
   **Return Value:** SigningContext: The production-level SigningContext instance.

3. `staging(cls) -> SigningContext`

   **Description:** Creates a staging-level SigningContext instance. It creates a FulcioClient and a RekorClient with staging settings.
   
   **Parameters:** None
   
   **Return Value:** SigningContext: The staging-level SigningContext instance.

4. `signer(self, identity_token, cache=True) -> Signer`

   **Description:** Creates a Signer instance with the provided identity token and cache configuration.
   
   **Parameters:**
   - `identity_token` (IdentityToken): The identity token used for signing.
   - `cache` (bool, optional): Flag indicating whether to cache the private key and signing certificate. Defaults to True.
   
   **Return Value:** Iterator[Signer]: An iterator yielding the Signer instance.

**Class SigningResult:**

**Introduction:**
The `SigningResult` class represents the result of a signing operation. It contains the input digest, the signed certificate in PEM format, the base64-encoded signature, and the log entry.

**Attributes:**

1. `input_digest: HexStr`: The input digest in hexadecimal format.
2. `cert_pem: PEMCert`: The signed certificate in PEM format.
3. `b64_signature: B64Str`: The base64-encoded signature.
4. `log_entry: LogEntry`: The log entry.

**Methods:**

1. `to_bundle(self) -> Bundle`

   **Description:** Converts the signing result to a Bundle object that can be used for verification and storage.
   
   **Parameters:** None
   
   **Return Value:** Bundle: The Bundle object representing the signing result.",1,1,0,"

Class Documentation:
",verify_verifier,classes_code,"**Class `LogEntryMissing(VerificationFailure)`**

This class represents an error that occurs when a transparency log does not have an entry for the given verification materials.

Attributes:
- `reason` (str): A string describing the reason for the error.
- `signature` (B64Str): The signature of the verification materials.
- `artifact_hash` (HexStr): The hash of the artifact.

**Class `CertificateVerificationFailure(VerificationFailure)`**

This class represents an error that occurs when there is a failure in verifying a signing certificate.

Attributes:
- `model_config` (ConfigDict): The model configuration (needed for the `exception` field, since exceptions are not trivially serializable).
- `reason` (str): A string describing the reason for the failure.
- `exception` (Exception): The exception that occurred during certificate verification.

**Class `Verifier`**

This class provides functionality to verify the authenticity of artifacts and signing certificates using a transparency log.

Methods:
- `__init__(self, rekor: RekorClient, fulcio_certificate_chain: List[Certificate])`: Initializes a new `Verifier` object with the specified `RekorClient` and chain of Fulcio certificates.
- `production(cls) -> Verifier`: Returns a `Verifier` object with a production setup.
- `staging(cls) -> Verifier`: Returns a `Verifier` object with a staging setup.
- `verify(self, materials: VerificationMaterials, policy: VerificationPolicy) -> VerificationResult`: Verifies the given `VerificationMaterials` using the specified `VerificationPolicy` and returns the result.

Parameter Types:
- `rekor` (RekorClient): An instance of the `RekorClient` class that provides access to a transparency log.
- `fulcio_certificate_chain` (List[Certificate]): A list of Fulcio certificates used for verification.

Return Type:
- `Verifier`: An instance of the `Verifier` class.

**Error Handling**

Possible error responses and their meanings:
- `CertificateVerificationFailure`: Occurs when there is a failure in verifying a signing certificate.
- `VerificationFailure`: Occurs when the verification process fails for some reason.
- `LogEntryMissing`: Occurs when the transparency log does not have an entry for the given verification materials.
- `InvalidRekorEntryError`: Occurs when the Rekor entry contents do not match other signing materials.
- `InvalidInclusionProofError`: Occurs when the inclusion proof supplied by Rekor for the artifact is invalid.
- `CheckpointError`: Occurs when the Rekor root hash is invalid.
- `InvalidSETError`: Occurs when the Signed Entry Timestamp (SET) supplied by Rekor for the artifact is invalid.
- `VerificationSuccess`: Indicates that the verification process was successful.",1,1,0,"

Description:

The Error class is the base class for all exceptions raised by sigstore-python. It provides a common interface for error handling and provides a default implementation of the diagnostics() method.

Class Attributes and Data Types:

None

Class Methods:

diagnostics() -> str:

This method returns a string that provides a brief description of the error. It should be used for error reporting and logging.

Parameters:

None

Return Values:

A string that provides a brief description of the error.

print_and_exit() -> None:

This method prints the error message to stderr and exits the program with a non-zero exit code. It should be used when an error occurs and the program needs to terminate.

Parameters:

raise_error (bool): If True, the original exception is raised. Defaults to False.

Return Values:

None

Error Handling:

Possible error responses:

- If the program encounters an error, it should raise an exception of type Error or one of its subclasses.

You are an AI system specialized at generating API documentation for given Python code. Be as objective as possible. You will be provided functions, classes, or Python scripts. 

The documentation follow the structure below:

1. Introduction: 
2. Class: If a class code is passed, document the following:
    - Class Name and Description
    - Class Attributes and Data types
    - Document each function in the class following the instructions below.
3. Functions: 
    - Description
    - Parameters and Data types
    - Return Values

4. Error Handling: Possible error responses

Create API documentation that is clear, concise, accurate, and user-centric. 

Special Caution:

- If no code is present in the prompt, do not generate generic examples, simply state ""No Code has been provided in the prompt"".
- Avoid speculative information and prioritize accuracy and completeness.
- Do not hallucinate variable names, function names, class names and the intended API usage. Only generate documentation for the code that is actually present.

                Another possible reason is that the workflow run has been
                triggered by a PR from a forked repository. PRs from forked
                repositories typically cannot be granted write access.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs, the function will raise an exception. The exception will be caught and handled by the calling function.

```python
try:
    # Do something that might raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # Handle the exception
```

## Usage

To use the MyClass class in your code, import it and create a new instance:

```python
from my_module import MyClass

my_object = MyClass('foo', 123)
```

You can then call the methods on the object:

```python
result = my_object.my_method('bar', 456)
```

## Testing

To test the MyClass class, create a new instance and call the methods:

```python
import unittest

from my_module import MyClass

class TestMyClass(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_my_method(self):
        my_object = MyClass('foo', 123)
        result = my_object.my_method('bar', 456)
        self.assertTrue(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Run the tests with the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest
```

This API provides a way to verify the integrity of the software supply chain by checking the provenance of the software artifacts.

Functions:
verify_materials(materials: str) -> VerificationResult:

Description:
Verifies the integrity of the software supply chain by checking the provenance of the software artifacts.

Parameters:
materials (str): The path to the directory containing the software artifacts to be verified.

Return Values:
VerificationResult: A VerificationResult object that contains the result of the verification.

Error Handling:
InvalidMaterials: An error that occurs when the provided materials are invalid.

verify_rekor_entry(entry: str) -> VerificationResult:

Description:
Verifies the integrity of the software supply chain by checking the provenance of the software artifacts using a Rekor entry.

Parameters:
entry (str): The Rekor entry to be verified.

Return Values:
VerificationResult: A VerificationResult object that contains the result of the verification.

Error Handling:
InvalidRekorEntry: An error that occurs when the provided Rekor entry is invalid.

RekorEntryMissing: An error that occurs when the provided Rekor entry is not found.

Example Usage:
from api import verify_materials, verify_rekor_entry

result = verify_materials(""path/to/materials"")
if result:
    print(""Verification successful!"")
else:
    print(""Verification failed!"")

result = verify_rekor_entry(""entry/hash"")
if result:
    print(""Verification successful!"")
else:
    print(""Verification failed!"")

In this example, we use the verify_materials and verify_rekor_entry functions to verify the integrity of the software supply chain. The verify_materials function takes a path to the directory containing the software artifacts to be verified, and returns a VerificationResult object that contains the result of the verification. The verify_rekor_entry function takes a Rekor entry to be verified, and returns a VerificationResult object that contains the result of the verification.

Note: The verify_materials and verify_rekor_entry functions are currently under development and may change in the future.

Conclusion:
This API provides a way to verify the integrity of the software supply chain by checking the provenance of the software artifacts. The verify_materials and verify_rekor_entry functions are currently under development and may change in the future.

Note: This API is currently under development and may change in the future.",1,0,0,"

The Verifier class is responsible for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a software artifact. It takes a VerificationMaterials object and a VerificationPolicy object as input, and returns a VerificationResult object.

Functions:

verify:

This is the main function of the Verifier class. It takes a VerificationMaterials object and a VerificationPolicy object as input, and returns a VerificationResult object.

Parameters:

materials (VerificationMaterials): The VerificationMaterials object containing the artifact to be verified, its signature, and its signing certificate.

policy (VerificationPolicy): The VerificationPolicy object containing the rules for verifying the artifact.

Return Values:

VerificationResult: The VerificationResult object containing the result of the verification process, which can be either a VerificationSuccess object or a VerificationFailure object.

Error Handling:

If the signing certificate is not valid, the verify function will return a CertificateVerificationFailure object.

If the signature is not valid, the verify function will return a VerificationFailure object.

If the Rekor entry is missing, the verify function will return a LogEntryMissing object.

If the Rekor entry is invalid, the verify function will return a VerificationFailure object.

If the Rekor inclusion proof is invalid, the verify function will return a VerificationFailure object.

If the Rekor root hash is invalid, the verify function will return a VerificationFailure object.

If the Rekor entry SET is invalid, the verify function will return a VerificationFailure object.

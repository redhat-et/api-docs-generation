                Another possible reason is that the workflow run has been

                The most common reason for this is incorrect
                configuration of the top-level `permissions` setting of the
                workflow YAML file. It should be configured like so:

                    permissions:
                      id-token: write

                    https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#adding-permissions-settings

                Another possible reason is that the workflow run has been
                triggered by a PR from a forked repository. PRs from forked
                repositories typically cannot be granted write access.

  - Parameters:
    - `cert`: An instance of the `Certificate` class representing the certificate to verify.
  - Returns: An instance of the `VerificationResult` class indicating the result of the verification. Possible results include `VerificationSuccess` or `VerificationFailure`.

Class Name: `UnsafeNoOp`
Description: This class represents an unsafe (no-op) verification policy that performs no actual verification.

Methods:
- `verify(self, cert: Certificate) -> VerificationResult`: Verifies the given certificate by logging a warning message and returning a `VerificationSuccess` result.
  - Parameters:
    - `cert`: An instance of the `Certificate` class representing the certificate to verify.
  - Returns: An instance of the `VerificationResult` class indicating the result of the verification, which will always be `VerificationSuccess`.

Class Name: `Identity`
Description: This class represents a verification policy based on the identity of the certificate.

Methods:
- `__init__(self, *, identity: str, issuer: str)`: Initializes the `Identity` object with the identity and issuer values.
  - Parameters:
    - `identity`: A string representing the expected identity value.
    - `issuer`: A string representing the OIDC issuer value.
  - Returns: None

- `verify(self, cert: Certificate) -> VerificationResult`: Verifies the given certificate by checking if the issuer is valid, and then verifying if the certificate's subject alternative names (SANs) contain the expected identity.
  - Parameters:
    - `cert`: An instance of the `Certificate` class representing the certificate to verify.
  - Returns: An instance of the `VerificationResult` class indicating the result of the verification. Possible results include `VerificationSuccess` or `VerificationFailure`.

### 4. `divide(a: int, b: int) -> float`

#### Description

This function takes two integer values, `a` (dividend) and `b` (divisor), and returns the quotient as a floating-point number.

#### Parameters

- `a` (integer): The integer value to be divided.
- `b` (integer): The integer value by which `a` will be divided.

#### Return Values

- Returns a floating-point number that represents the quotient of `a` divided by `b`.

## Error Handling

In case of any errors or issues, the API functions may raise the following exceptions:

- `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when the divisor in the `divide` function is zero.
- `TypeError`: Raised when the input parameters in any function are not of the expected data type (integer).

When any of these exceptions occur, appropriate error messages will be displayed, indicating the cause of the error. It is recommended to handle these exceptions in the calling code to ensure proper error handling and graceful termination of the program if necessary.",1,1,1,"

## Introduction
This API provides functions to perform operations on a list of numbers.

## Functions

### `add_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int`
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.

#### Parameters
- `numbers` (List[int]): A list of integers.

#### Return Value
- Returns an integer that represents the sum of all the numbers in the list.

### `multiply_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int`
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the product of all the numbers in the list.

#### Parameters
- `numbers` (List[int]): A list of integers.

#### Return Value
- Returns an integer that represents the product of all the numbers in the list.

## Error Handling
- If the input list is empty, both functions will return 0, as there are no numbers to sum or multiply.
- If the input list contains non-integer values, both functions will raise a `TypeError` with a message indicating that the input should only contain integers.",1,1,1,"
